# Snake

## Initialization
We need to create the cells of the game board:
```eve
search
  width = 40
  
commit
  [#cell x: range[from: 0 to: width - 1]]
```

## Draw the game
Start by showing a grid of the cells with their default styling.
```eve
search
  cell = [#cell x]
bind @browser
  [#div children:
    [#span cell sort: x, style: [height: 10, width: 10, backgroundColor: "black", display: "inline-block"]]]
```

If a cell is currently selected, color it green.
```
search @session @browser
  cell = [#cell selected]
  [#span cell style]

bind @browser
  style.backgroundColor := "green"
```

## Select cell
Every frame advance one cell, looping around when it gets to the end.
```
search
	[#time frames]
  x = mod[value: frames by: 40]
	cell = [#cell x]
  
bind
	cell.selected := true
```
